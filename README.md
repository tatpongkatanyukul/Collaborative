> "Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific techniques from statistics and computer science to systematically extract knowledge from data."

"commucable to people"
  * develop a shared language
    * Same word, different meanings, e.g., planetary features vs ML features.
    * Connotations, e.g., Novelty vs Outlier vs Anomaly.
    * key points: 
      * Same words can have different meanings, depending on the context.
      * Define terms/jargon when working in multidiscilinary teams to avoid confusion and errors.
    * The machine needs a language too
      * Representation (relates to questions we want to ask)
      * Explanations/justifications (so that human can understand)
    * key points: 
      * There is not one single correct way to represent your data - it depends on the nature of the data and the aims of your project.
      * The way the data are represented may limit what conclusions you can draw from your data.
      * Knowing why a model behaves the way it does is also important beyond just performance metrics.
