Walkthrough example

Example inspired by [Hsu et al. in Chest 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4665738/#:~:text=Indwelling%20arterial%20catheters%20(IACs)%20are%20used%20in%20the%20ICU%20setting,stable%20IAC%20use%20over%20time).
Hsu et al. addressed a key question: "is the placement of an indwelling arterial catheter (IAC) associated with reduced mortality, in patients who are mechanically ventilated but do not require vasopressor support?"

  * IACs are used extensively in the intensive care unit for continuous monitoring of blood pressure and are thought to  be more accurate and reliable than standard, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring.
  * IACs also have the added benefit of allowing for easier arterial blood gas collection which can reduce the need for repeated arterial punctures.
  * Given  IAC invasive nature, IACs carry risks of bloodstream infection and vascular injury, so the evidence of a beneficial effect requires evaluation.
  * The primary outcomes of interest selected was 28-day mortality
  * the secondary outcomes include ICU and hospital length-of-stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mean number of blood gas measurements made.
  * The authors identified the encounter-centric 'arterial catheter placement' as their exposure of interest and carried out a propensity score analysis to test the relationship between the exposure and outcomes uning MIMIC.
  * The result is that the presence of an IAC is not associated with a difference in 28-day mortality, in hemodynamically stable patients who are mechanically ventillated.
  
Introduction: it is important to formulate the research problem properly and transform it into a research query.
The process of developing a research question involves defining several components of the study, which include:
  * Study sample (For whom is this research question relevant?)
  * Exposure (The drug, maneuver, event or characteristic we are investigating)
  * Outcome of interest (What are we measuring as an outcome variable?)
  
With these components in mind, the researcher must decide which study design is best or most feasible for answering the research question.
