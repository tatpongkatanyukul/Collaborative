Walkthrough example

Example inspired by [Hsu et al. in Chest 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4665738/#:~:text=Indwelling%20arterial%20catheters%20(IACs)%20are%20used%20in%20the%20ICU%20setting,stable%20IAC%20use%20over%20time).
Hsu et al. addressed a key question: "is the placement of an indwelling arterial catheter (IAC) associated with reduced mortality, in patients who are mechanically ventilated but do not require vasopressor support?"

  * IACs are used extensively in the intensive care unit for continuous monitoring of blood pressure and are thought to  be more accurate and reliable than standard, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring.
  * IACs also have the added benefit of allowing for easier arterial blood gas collection which can reduce the need for repeated arterial punctures.
  * Given  IAC invasive nature, IACs carry risks of bloodstream infection and vascular injury, so the evidence of a beneficial effect requires evaluation.
  * The primary outcomes of interest selected was 28-day mortality
  * the secondary outcomes include ICU and hospital length-of-stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mean number of blood gas measurements made.
  * The authors identified the encounter-centric 'arterial catheter placement' as their exposure of interest and carried out a propensity score analysis to test the relationship between the exposure and outcomes uning MIMIC.
  * The result is that the presence of an IAC is not associated with a difference in 28-day mortality, in hemodynamically stable patients who are mechanically ventillated.
