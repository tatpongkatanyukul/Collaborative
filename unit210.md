## 2.10: Sensitivity Analysis and Model Validation

Once youâ€™ve finished your primary analysis, your results and design decisions, such as inclusion criteria and cutoff thresholds still need to be validated. It can be easy to produce misleading conclusions if you forgo examining your analysis. In particular, you should answer these questions:
  * Does the data meet the assumptions of your model? 
  * Would you get the same result with slightly different data? 
How confident should you be in your results? 
  * How much would your results change if your inclusion criteria were slightly different?
  
These steps are especially important if you have a causal interpretation of your results, since causal inference is often limited by the assumptions made in study design and analysis and this is particularly pronounced when working with observational health data.

## What are Sensitivity Analysis and Model Validation?

Sensitivity Analysis and Model Validation are both attempts to assess the appropriateness of a particular model specification and to appreciate the strength of the conclusions being drawn from such a model.

Model validation is the process of assessing how well your model fits within your specific research dataset. It is checking the appropriateness of your model.

Sensitivity analysis is the process of gaining confidence in the generalizability of the result of the primary analysis and is important in situations where a model is likely to be used in a future research investigation or in clinical practice.
