"Meaningful evaluation"
  * V-FASTR classifier
    * Instead of ROC, which is risky, since ML is based on an assumption that the training and deploying data have the same distribution
    * They test the system in the way it will be deployed, i.e., taking previous data and let it predicts known pulsar, candidate, none as the project goes.
    * successively held out evaluation, replicating what they will be used in real life.
    * Also, show how much human effort the ML system can save.

Key ingredients for successful collaboration in data science:
  * Expertise
  * Shared language
  * Knowing your data's characteristics
  * Meaningful evaluation

1.02 A Data Science Revolution in Healthcare

Successful data analytics
  * Sufficient clean, unbiased feature data
  * Advanced analytics/AI techniques
  * Right outputs in the right place / sound application and deployment in the real-world setting
    * how to deploy it in the effective way
    
Four key technologies
  * Large-scale data warehousing and analytics
    * get data into the same place
  * Sensor networks and personal computing
  * Machine intelligence
    * challenge: better use of the limited data
  * Public cloud computing
    * provide uniformity access/treat to data collecting from or storing in different locations.
