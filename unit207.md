## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an essential step in any research analysis. The primary aim of exploratory analysis is to examine the data for distribution, outliers, and anomalies to direct speciﬁc testing of your hypothesis. 
It also provides tools for hypothesis generation by visualizing and understanding the data usually through graphical representation [1].

According to Howard Seltman (Carnegie Mellon University), “loosely speaking, any method of looking at data that does not include formal statistical modeling and inference falls under the term exploratory data analysis” [4].
...
EDA is a fundamental early step after data collection (see subsection 2.03) and pre-processing (see subsection 2.04), where the data is simply visualized, plotted, manipulated, without any assumptions, in order to help assess the quality of the data and building models. “Most EDA techniques are graphical in nature with a few quantitative techniques. The reason for the heavy reliance on graphics is that by its very nature the main role of EDA is to explore, and graphics gives the analysts unparalleled power to do so while being ready to gain insight into the data. There are many ways to categorize the many EDA techniques” [5].

The interested reader will ﬁnd further information in the textbooks of Hill and Lewicki [6] or the NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook [1]. Relevant R packages are available on the CRAN website [7].

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis

> "It is important to understand what you CAN DO, before you learn to measure how WELL you seem to have DONE it."
- J. W. Tukey (1977)

> exploratory and comfirmatory (analysis) can and should proceed side by side
