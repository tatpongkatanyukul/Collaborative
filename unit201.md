# 2.01 Formulating the Research Question

Learning objectives
  * Unverstand how to turn  a clinical question into a research question
  * Principles of choosing a sample
  * Approaches and potential pitfalls
  * Principles of defining the exposure of interest
  * Principles of defining the outcomes
  * Selecting an appropriate study design
  
FINER mnimonic
  * feasible
  * interesting
  * novel
  * ethical
  * relevant
 
PICO
  * P: The population of subjects defined by the researcher (Patients/study sample)
  * I: The drug, event or characteristic that we are basing our alternative hypothesis on (Intervention/exposure)
  * C: The “unexposed” or control group needed to assess the effectiveness of healthcare interventions (Control)
  * O: The predefined outcome of interest (Outcome)
 
Intervention
  * Example Arterial catheter placement
    * Does timing of placement matter?
     	* It is not just what is your intervention, but when you apply your intervention.
	
Control
  * Example: in the case of the IAC study, the control group is fairly straightforward: patients receiving  mechanical ventilation (MV) who did not have an IAC placed.
  * an alternative control group could be all ICU patients no receiving an IAC.
  * However, the inclusion of patients not receiving MV results in a control group with lower severity of illness and expected mortality than patients receiving MV, which would bias in favor of not using IACs.
  * "counterfactual": --> find the counterfactual group
