# 2.01 Formulating the Research Question

Learning objectives
  * Unverstand how to turn  a clinical question into a research question
  * Principles of choosing a sample
  * Approaches and potential pitfalls
  * Principles of defining the exposure of interest
  * Principles of defining the outcomes
  * Selecting an appropriate study design
  
FINER mnimonic
  * feasible
  * interesting
  * novel
  * ethical
  * relevant
 
PICO
  * P: The population of subjects defined by the researcher (Patients/study sample)
  * I: The drug, event or characteristic that we are basing our alternative hypothesis on (Intervention/exposure)
  * C: The “unexposed” or control group needed to assess the effectiveness of healthcare interventions (Control)
  * O: The predefined outcome of interest (Outcome)
 
Intervention
  * Example Arterial catheter placement
    * Does timing of placement matter?
     	* It is not just what is your intervention, but when you apply your intervention.
	
Control
  * Example: in the case of the IAC study, the control group is fairly straightforward: patients receiving  mechanical ventilation (MV) who did not have an IAC placed.
  * an alternative control group could be all ICU patients no receiving an IAC.
  * However, the inclusion of patients not receiving MV results in a control group with lower severity of illness and expected mortality than patients receiving MV, which would bias in favor of not using IACs.
  * "counterfactual": --> find the counterfactual group
  
Outcome: several different types of outcomes can be considered.
  * Intermediate or mechanistic (Informs etiological pathways, but may not immediately impact patients)
    * Number of artirial blood draws
    * Ventilator setting changes
    * Vasoactive medication change
  * Patient-centered (Informs outcomes important to patients, but may lack mechanistic insights)
    * Comfort scales
    * Quality of life indices
    * Mortality (e.g. 28-day or 90-day mortality)
    * Adverse event rates
  * Healthcare-system centered (e.g., resource utilization, or costs)
    * Hospitalizaion costs
    * Added clinician workload
    
What is a good outcome to measure
  * Go back to FINER questions
    * Hospital mortality?
    * Opinions of patient? ...
    
Clinical question: "Should I put an arterial catheter in my patient" --> Research Question in PICO: Summary
  * Patients?
    * Mechanically ventilated, no shock
  * Intervention?
    * Arterial catheter within 2 days of ventilator
  * Comparator?
    * No arterial catheter, but blood gas checked
  * Outcome(s)
    * Primary: mortality
    * Secondary: lenght of stay (LOS), # blood gases
> "Among mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients who are not receiving vasoactive medications (**P**), is placement of an AC (**I**) after initiation of MV (as compared with not receiving an AC [**C**]) associated with improved 28-day mortality rates (**O**), length of stay, and the number of blood gas measurements per day (supporting/balancing secondary outcomes, intermediate/mechanistic O)?" 

Formulating a Research Question
  * Like scientific methods, **be systematic in forming your question!**
  * Think about **value and feasibility of question** using **FINER** mnemonic
    * Are people interested? Am I interested? Is it useful to the world?
  * **Construct question using PICO** framework
  * Develop **rejectable hypotheses**
