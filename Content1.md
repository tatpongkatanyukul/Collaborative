"commucable to people"
  * develop a shared language
    * Same word, different meanings, e.g., planetary features vs ML features.
    * Connotations, e.g., Novelty vs Outlier vs Anomaly.
    * key points: 
      * Same words can have different meanings, depending on the context.
      * Define terms/jargon when working in multidiscilinary teams to avoid confusion and errors.
    * The machine needs a language too
      * Representation (relates to questions we want to ask)
      * Explanations/justifications (so that human can understand)
    * key points: 
      * There is not one single correct way to represent your data - it depends on the nature of the data and the aims of your project.
      * The way the data are represented may limit what conclusions you can draw from your data.
      * Knowing why a model behaves the way it does is also important beyond just performance metrics.
    * Understand your data: key points: 
      * Know what the valid ranges for your data are.
      * Inspect your data to see if there are values that don't make sense.
      * If there are unusual values, check with those who collected the data or handled the instruments that collected the data.
    * Deal with missing data: key points: 
      * Inspect your data to determine if there is missing data. Sometimes, missing data is coded as "99999"
      * Why is the data missing? This requires you to know how the data was collected?
      * Sometimes, missing data arises because a value is unmeasurable (e.g., eccentricity cannot be calculated for a point such as a star)
      * Don't just blindly fill ("impute") the missing values without first understanding why the value is missing
    * Valid range of features
