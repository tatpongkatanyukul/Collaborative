The reproducibility crisis is an issue facing scientific researchers around the world, where the results of studies are not able to be replicated. In recent meta-analyses, experts have found that between 40-80% of studies in psychology, cardiology, hematology, and more were not reproducible.

Reproducibility is generally divided into two major groups:

  * Conceptual Replication: You are asking the same question, but doing so in a different way than originally done. This tests the validity of the underlying theory.
  * Exact Replication: You are asking the exact same question in the same way as was originally done. This tests the validity of theoretical statistical conclusions.

Failing to achieve exact replication is particularly concerning, because it calls into question the validity of studies previously published in the literature.

There are many factors currently contributing to the reproducibility crisis, including:

  * Pressure to publish: Scientists may perform statistical tests which depict their results in the most favorable way for publication.

  * Selective reporting: Oftentimes, only the most positive outcomes or analyses are reported in the literature and all the data is not shared.

  * Insufficient mentoring: In academic settings, students without proper mentorship may interpret or analyze data incorrectly, resulting in results that are not able to be reproduced.

  * Methods - codes not available: Reviewers and scientists are often unable to verify the replicability of a study because the authors do not make the code public.

  * Insufficient peer review: Many peer-reviewed journals do not go through the author's code, which can lead to incorrect analyses being published.
  
  
## Best-Practices to Ensure Reproducibility  

There are many steps we can take as students, researchers, and scientists to perform studies and analyses which are fully-reproducible.

Most notably, we can:
  * Consider the power of statistical tests and their weaknesses.
  * Use prior knowledge to perform 'sanity' checks of your work along the way to avoid reaching incorrect conclusions.
  * Be careful to use statistical inference and hypothesis testing correctly, understand their assumptions, and only employ them when the assumptions are met.
  * Stay current by using modern, field-accepted analysis methodologies.
  * Think carefully about correcting for multiple comparisons in large studies.
  * Write a code that is highly-commented to explain the reasoning behind the analyses done.
  * Release the code for the public when publishing a study so peers can follow all steps of your data analysis. (Few scientific studies today are published with the code freely available for others to use, and hopefully this trend will change in the coming years).
  * There are a plethora of tools available to help you increase the reproducibility of your code and enable others to understand what you have done.

[Survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis) is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems.


***Odds ratio*** is more widely used than relative risks.
